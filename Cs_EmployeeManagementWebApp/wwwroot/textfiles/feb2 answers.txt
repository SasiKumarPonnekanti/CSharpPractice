1) we cannot have methods of same name and parameters but differ in return type
2)Private virtual or abstract members are not allowed.
3)
4)yes Ofcourse we can 
5)
16) we cannot use sealed keyword for method
15) function' is abstract but it is contained in nonabstract class 'class'
    A method cannot be an abstract member of a nonabstract class.
   A sealedclass cannot be used as a base class. Therefore, it is useless to have a virtual method in sealed class.

14)A class is required to implement all the abstract members in the base class, unless the class is also abstract.

13) A method cannot be an abstract member of a nonabstract class.

12)yes

11)

10)Elements defined in a namespace cannot be explicitly declared as private, protected, protected internal or 
private protected.
Type declarations in a namespace can have either public or internal access. If no accessibility is 
specified, internal is the default.
